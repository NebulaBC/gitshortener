Git-Shortener is a github/gitlab link shortener. I created this service around
2/22, but accedentily deleted it. This is a re-write.

This project uses the FLAW stack:
Flask sqLite Apache Waitress


Notes:

- This is not in a working state yet so do not try to deploy. Once it is working I will supply instructions.
- links.db will be emptied after testing for obvious reasons
