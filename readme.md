Git-Shortener is a github/gitlab link shortener. I created this service around
2/22, but accedentily deleted it. This is a re-write.

This project uses the FLAW stack:
Flask sqLite Apache Waitress

To setup, 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can edit `config.py` to your liking. After you are done with that you can

```
python3 app.py
```

to start.

IPs from links.sqlite are encoded, if you would like to decode an ip to view it you can run

```
python3 DecodeIP.py
```

and follow the steps it gives you
